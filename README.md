This project implements **audio diarization**, the process of partitioning an audio stream into homogeneous segments according to speaker identity. It includes **feature extraction**, **clustering**, and **timestamp-based segmentation**, providing a comprehensive solution for speaker identification and segmentation in audio files.

-The **primary goal** of this project is to:
-**Extract features** from audio data.
-**Reduce dimensionality** for effective clustering.
**Estimate** the **number of speakers** dynamically.
-Generate **timestamps** for speaker-specific audio segments.
-Save speaker-specific audio segments for further analysis.

-**Feature Extraction**: Utilizes advanced signal processing techniques to extract meaningful features from audio.
-**Clustering**: Implements clustering methods to identify distinct speakers.
-**Dimensionality Reduction**: Uses techniques like PCA for optimal clustering.
-**Speaker Segmentation**: Provides precise timestamps for each speaker.
-**Audio Output**: Saves processed segments for downstream applications.

The **project** is built with the following **dependencies**:
-Python 3.8+
-**Librosa** for **audio processing**.
-**NumPy** and **Pandas** for **data manipulation**.
-**Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for **visualization**.
-**Scikit-learn** for clustering and dimensionality reduction.

The **project generates**:
-Clusters representing different speakers.
-Timestamps for each speaker's segments.
-Individual audio files for each speaker.
